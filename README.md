# Preamble

	This application is a real-time builder and simulator for basic combinatorial logic-circuits.

	It is my first time developing an application of this complexity, and it took me *many* tries to come up with something that scales well; In the process though, I've learned some hard lessons about software development, and I've finally created an app that has been on the back of my mind for a couple years.

	There are still *many* things on my to-do list for this application (for example the interface is a little rough, and the code is written in a multi-threaded style but isnt actually multi-threaded yet!), but I'll need to take a break from this project for a little while to pursue some other things that are important to me.


# Who is this application for?

- This app is for students taking introductory courses in computer-architecture.
Being able to play with combinatorial circuits in real-time is really helpful for understanding how they work, as well as quickly prototyping them. There wasn't any obvious software options for this doing this back when I was taking comp-arch, and I often ended up using Quartus to build most of the circuits we were shown in class, however I found Quartus to be very difficult to use, and it didnt seem to have functionality for interactively simulating circuits. If I could've submitted my homework as templates built with this application, it would have saved me a lot of time and effort.

- This app is a for professors teaching computer-architecture.
When taking Computer Architecture I & II in university, professors usually drew the circuits on a whiteboard and then explained what they would do, but they werent really *demonstrating* them. I created this app to close the software gap, giving professors a convenient way to visually interact with circuits in real-time, *showing* students what they do.

- This app is also a toy for people who just want to play with logic circuits.
