============================================================
Long term.
------------------------------------------------------------

> Add new content type: RAM
- it will store an array of uint32 data.
- it will have its own links, rather than using cell links.
- it will only have one target per link.
- RAM targets: [addr, data, read, write, clock, output]
- allow users to configure placed RAM size.
- allow users to import and export RAM contents


> Add new content type: Bus
- can have a multiple of 32 bits of width (ex: 256-bit).
- stores its own list of links ("bus_links"), with bit-offset,
	cell-target, (and mask?) of lanes being read or written.
- bus will have a draw path made up of multiple line segments.
- all buses with the same bus_name will share properties.


> Add new content variant: Links -> Wires
- wires will essentially transpile to links (on a per-template basis)
	when building simulation data.
- will have draw path consisting of multiple line-segments.
- will have single cell-output as value source (checked by validation functions),
	but potentially many cell-inputs i.e. destinations.
- wires can be connected to nothing since user may first start
	by laying out unconnected wire.


> Implement string-based Chunked-Merge-Radix sort (off-topic):
- string returns 0 if out-of-range char is requested.
- break main array into 32 (example) sub-arrays.
- each subarray performs string-radix sort,
	starting from length of longest string in subarray
	(we break data into subarrays so that length-outliers
	dont cause whole sort operation to be in that length.)
- afterwards, the sorted subarrays are merged by merge-sorts.
* lots of multithreading potential.


> Implement memory pool in C++
* different types could potentially be allocated from
the same pool - in particular, a struct and its child-structs
could be contiguous.



> WireSim
* a successor to this application, using electrical components instead of logical ones.
* wires connect by touching, and voltage/current is sent between blocks by
placing wire along the perimiter (make sure to support both point-contact and line-contact).
* should wires have resistivity and capacitance?
* four options to consider for simulation:
	- we may treat all touching wire segments as a single wire.
		(simple, but not physically realistic)
	- we treat wire segments as seperate.
		(easier multithreading)
	- we first join all touching wires into one, then split it again using some length-heuristic.
		(harder, but easier multhithreading, and more performant than using original build).
	- join touching wire segments into a single wire,
		then have each wire do finite-element-analysis,
		i.e. treat single combined wire as seperate length-wise segments internally.
	* I will likely start with the first "touching-as-single-wire" approach during development.
* allow blocks to overlap? (try to make that a "yes")
* progressively cache sum of wires+components from self and child blocks
	during simulation-build.
* start with C++ this time, and try to build entire app in WASM if possible,
	with only a little bit of glue code for interface.


> Optimization: Leaf node collapsing (Template tree)
- leaf nodes in the template tree with a small number of cells can be collapsed into their parents
before building a simulation-tree or render-tree to reduce block overhead by 1 level.
- note that generating a seperate CollapsedBlockLibrary will introduce a bunch of complexity,
but if build/render performance is a problem, this is one potential solution.




============================================================
Near-term.
------------------------------------------------------------


> User stylesheets
- allow user to add and remove their own stylesheets for the app.


> Multithreading notes:
* C++: it would be strongly advised to create memory pools to allocate various
fixed or variable length structs to prevent an absurd levels of heap-memory fragmentation,
as this will allow writing tree-structs without major performance problems.
^ learn about C++ memory allocators, to see if it is related to what I am trying to do.
? performance: seperate task-internal and task-external links?
* potential method to make cell+link building multithreaded:
	- when generating simblock tree, assign cell indices (c_id -> c_index),
		but also emit a list of {c_id, simblock_index} tuples.
	- send a list/queue of pairs to each thread.
	- given each thread has shared (read-only) access to the simblock tree,
	this should be enough information to allow generating cell data and link data.



> Multithreading plan:
- service workers will act as threads
- simulation:
	*build*
	1. [s] create SimulationBlock tree
	2. [s] create cell data
	3. [s] create link data
	4. [s] create threads, and send cell+link data to them
	5. [m] trigger task initialization (init cell values, local propagation, etc.)
	*loop*
	1. [m] update threads
	2. [s] gather and spread ('gather': request updated cell values, 'spread': send updated values to destination tasks)
- rendering:
	TODO



> add Graphs panel
- use same graphing utility class as performance panel?
- have a table of graphs, which show selected cell output-values over time.


> Hotkeys panel
- put in sidebar.
* create Hotkeys class? (for named bindings such as "Hotkeys.state_move_L" and "*.delta_move_L")


> Performance panel
- create a tab in the header for viewing performance graphs.
- create Graph data structure and GraphComponent for UI.
- add records of [time_stamp, time_taken] pairs into arrays,
	and use object fields instead of maps with string keys.
- rework performance class:
	- frameIndex = frameNumber % graphLength
	- Performance.arrayX[frameIndex] = time_millis.


> Misc settings panel
* add panel for configuring various game settings.
- misc settings
	- movement speed
	- grid snap
	- cursor radius
- rendering settings
	- 1-bit mode			draw value text as just 1 or 0, instead of full 32-bit value.
	- draw cell bits		draw all 32 bits as seperate rectangles for cells (will require optimized renderer).
	- draw depth			maximum recursive drawing depth for blocks nested inside blocks.
	- max drawn blocks		maximum number of blocks allowed to be drawn (safety value to prevent program from freezing).



> seperate tree types (RenderBlock and SimulationBlock) into a data-nodes (XBlock) and a tree-manager (XBlockTree).
- nodes should not initialize recursively. instead, an init function should be called in tree-manager which
may have recursive behaviour.
- initialization may be broken into multiple phases (for example with SimulationBlocks), with seperate recursive init-functions.
^ RenderBlock may not see the same benefits from this, but it is worth examining as well.


> add list management features for BlockTemplates


> UndoStack
- add a struct which has a list of undo states consisting of:
	- block library JSON
	- timestamp
	- description of operation performed (which produced the new state)
- add "Undo" panel for moving through the list of states
- allow saving (and loading) the entire UndoStack struct as JSON


> c++ server
* most of the update loop can happen in c++
- the browser sends updated blockTemplates on change.
- the browser sends request to update simulation by N steps.
- the browser sends request to get render data for cells, links, etc. (which will get cell data from simulation)
* first objective: find way to communicate with a local c++ compute server (requires basic networking in c++)
* the same code that is used to implement the c++ compute server can be used for WASM calls,
	allowing some parts of javascript implementation to be deprecated.
	(c++:"GameServer.cpp", wasm:"GameServer.js")
* to detect if building with emscripten (for example to use different threading model in WASM then C++),
	the __EMSCRIPTEN__ is defined by emcc/em++, see:
	https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html
* WARNING: emscripten is a 32-bit platform, so size_t is also 32-bit!



> troubleshoot poor performance on older devices with modest processing power
- why is my laptop browser struggling to render even a mostly empty scene?
! it is a software rendering problem - empty webGL canvas already costs 65% cpu to render!
(even a highly optimized renderer cant really do much when blank canvas is overwhelming the cpu by rendering nothing)


> add a "View" panel
- add inputs for some draw settings.
- and "Pan" mode button, for navigating with mouse.



> Renderer improvements:
* most of these can just be done on the c++ side.
* draw lines using triangles.
- simplify render-tree generation and updates (even at the expense of performance).
- instead of cells/celldatas being in treeBlocks, just generate a shared per-tree queue.
^ same goes for other content types.
- cells should have simcell index to speed up and simplify value access.
- give cells a Colour class for easier value editing (for feature parity with c++).



> Re-implement UI in Svelte
* combine functionality found in GameControls, and InputUtil.
* rework GameUI
* add shared mouse-following tooltip component (confined to window area).

> decouple which panel is open and current placement mode.
> add blue background to panel buttons indicating which mode is active (try mixing colours when both open and active)
